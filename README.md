## üåü Features

- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive UI built with Razor Pages
- **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with self-hosted runners
- **Self-Hosted Infrastructure**: Deployed on Proxmox containers for full control
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast loading times and smooth user experience

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Infrastructure

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: ASP.NET Core Razor Pages
- **Backend**: C# / .NET Core
- **Hosting**: Self-hosted on Proxmox VE
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with runners
- **Containerization**: Linux containers (CT) on Proxmox

### DevOps Pipeline

```
GitHub Push ‚Üí GitHub Actions ‚Üí Self-hosted Runner (Proxmox CT) ‚Üí Container Update
```

The deployment process is fully automated:

1. **Code Push**: Push to `main` branch triggers the pipeline
2. **GitHub Runner**: Running on Proxmox container picks up the job
3. **Automated Deployment**: Runner updates the application container with minimal downtime (too lazy to fix zero downtime)
4. **Live Update**: Changes are immediately available on the live site
